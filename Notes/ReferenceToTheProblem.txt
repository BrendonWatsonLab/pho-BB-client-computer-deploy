I was running into an error that only occurred when executing a script using scheduled jobs. The script would run fine when executed manually. The issue turned out to be a credential and timing issue. Since the error record ID was in the log file, error messages were clear and using tags, I was able to narrow it down in no time.

Having tried other methods to generate log files and this module is by far the easiest to use.


The PSFramework is module works great, is reliable, and gives you the most control over verbose messages.
